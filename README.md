# Carbon Footprint Tracker

A prototype app in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for the experiment design assignment of the [02808 Personal Data Interaction for Mobile and Wearables](http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2018-2019/02808) DTU course (2018-2019).

## About the project

The assignment is part of the final project about designing, experimenting on and implementing a self-tracking system based on the principles of human-computer interaction and the 5-stages model of personal informatics systems ([Li et al., 2010](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753409)).

We chose to create a system to track the carbon footprint of a user's groceries.
